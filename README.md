Title: INTERPLAY OF QUANTUM SPIN HALL EFFECT AND SPONTANEOUS TIME-REVERSAL SYMMETRY BREAKING IN ELECTRON-HOLE BILAYERS: TRANSPORT STUDY

Abstract: This repository contains the code used to perform the transport calculations on a Corbino disc using Kwant. It calculates the edge and bulk conductance as a function of electron and hole densities or E_G. The input file for the code is named Eg_input.txt generated from a MATLAB code for a fixed tunneling parameter A. 

The code generates the edge or bulk conductance as a function of energy (eV_{dc}) for a fixed E_G. filename.py generates a 2D contour plot.

The parameters of the Hamiltonian are the following:

A: Tunneling strength
B: hbar^2/2*m
Dz: Bulk inversion asymmetry
D1R: Real part of Delta_s
D1I: Imaginary part of Delta_s
D2R: Real part of Delta_p
D2I: Imaginary part of Delta_p
