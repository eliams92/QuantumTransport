Title: INTERPLAY OF QUANTUM SPIN HALL EFFECT AND SPONTANEOUS TIME-REVERSAL SYMMETRY BREAKING IN ELECTRON-HOLE BILAYERS: TRANSPORT STUDY

Abstract: This repository contains the code used to do the transport calculations on a Corbino disc using Kwant. It calculates the edge and bulk conductance as a function of electron and hole densitites or E_G. The input file for the code is named Eg_input.txt generated from a MATLAB code for a fixed tunneling parameter A. 

The code generates the edge or bulk conductance as a function of energy (eV_{dc}) for a fixed E_G. filename.py generates a 2D contour plot.
